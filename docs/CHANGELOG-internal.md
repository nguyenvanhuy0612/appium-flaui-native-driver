A running log of work sessions, written so anyone (incl. a "not very familiar" reader) can follow the
project's evolution. Newest first.

## 2026-06-03 — Project bootstrap: design → decisions → plan → verified foundation

**Context.** Goal: a new Appium 3 Windows driver backed by a compiled C# FlaUI sidecar, living alongside
the user's `appium-novawindows2-driver`. Priority order locked: **stability > framework coverage > speed**.

**What was produced (docs):**
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-03-...-design.md` — full design (architecture, seam, anti-hang, Appium 3).
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — ADR-001..011 (names, C# FlaUI backend, JSON-op seam, HTTP transport, no-PowerShell,
  bundled binaries, Appium-3-only, etc.).
- `docs/NEXT-STEPS.md`, `docs/SUBAGENTS.md` (+ `.claude/agents/*`), and the Phase 0–1 plan.

**What was BUILT and VERIFIED on macOS (real green tests):**
- `sidecar/UiaScheduler.cs` + tests — the anti-hang core (**Spike C**). Proven: a frozen work item
  fails fast via the watchdog, the worker thread is poisoned & replaced, and the scheduler stays usable;
  cooperative cancellation does not poison. **3/3 xUnit pass** (`net9.0`, cross-platform).
- `lib/backend/ops.ts` — the structured JSON op contract (the seam).
- `lib/backend/rpc-client.ts` — localhost HTTP/JSON client with `BackendResult` unwrap + `RpcError`.
- `lib/backend/sidecar.ts` — sidecar process manager (spawn → read `PORT=` → health → clean stop). This is
  the Node half of **Spike A**, tested against `tests/fixtures/fake-sidecar.mjs`.
- **8/8 mocha unit tests pass.**

**What was AUTHORED but is WINDOWS-VERIFICATION-PENDING (do not assume working):**
- `sidecar/FlaUiSidecar.csproj` (net8.0-windows, FlaUI.UIA3/UIA2), `sidecar/Program.cs` (Kestrel host,
  `/status`+`/session`+`/op`, port handshake, stdin heartbeat), `sidecar/ElementRegistry.cs`,
  `sidecar/OpInterpreter.cs` (find op), `scripts/publish-sidecar.mjs`, `lib/driver.ts`.
- These reference FlaUI (Windows-only) and `@appium/base-driver` (not yet installed), so they do **not**
  build here by design.

**Open items flagged inline for the Windows pass:**
1. Reconcile `@appium/base-driver`/`@appium/types` versions to the Appium-3 line; add to `package.json`.
2. `OpInterpreter.BuildCondition`: confirm FlaUI's real true-condition symbol (used `new TrueCondition()`).
3. `ElementRegistry`: refactor to a FlaUI-free seam so eviction logic is unit-testable.
4. Spike B (FlaUI find + CacheRequest page source) — run on Windows; record findings.
5. Real anti-hang against a genuinely frozen app (Phase 4) — the macOS test simulates it with a blocking work item.

**Why this sequencing.** The two riskiest assumptions (anti-hang works; sidecar-from-Node works) were the
ones provable without Windows — so they were proven first. Everything Windows-only was authored with clear
"verify on Windows" markers rather than claimed as done.
